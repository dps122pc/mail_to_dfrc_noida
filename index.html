          <ol>
            <li><b>Unjustified annual fee hikes,</b> especially the mandatory 5% increase, which compounded with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), often exceeds 10%.</li>
            
            <li><b>Frequent changes in school uniforms</b> ‚Äî both in design and color ‚Äî every year, adding unnecessary financial pressure on parents.</li>
            
            <li><b>Switching textbooks and curriculum patterns frequently,</b> leading to confusion and additional costs.</li>

            <li><b>Lack of sibling discount policy,</b>  which many reputed schools follow to support families with more than one child enrolled.</li>

          In the current economic climate, where <b>inflation is high</b> and annual <b>salary increments</b> for most working professionals have seen a <b>steep decline</b>, such changes are becoming increasingly difficult to manage.
